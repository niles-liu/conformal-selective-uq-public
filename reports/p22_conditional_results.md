# Results — P2.2 *calibrated* multi-group conditional conformal (2026-06-30)

> Paired with `p22_conditional_preregistration.md` (frozen first). All numbers from
> `python src/run_p22.py`, seeds {0,1,2}, target 90%. The frozen `aci_cqr` (single-axis) and
> `aci_cqr_multi` (P2.1 union) are untouched; `cqr_conditional` (+ the report-only
> `cqr_conditional_aci` hybrid) is the additive P2.2 variant. Reproduces bit-for-bit.

## Headline — **QUALIFIED (efficiency + method-calibration clean; pre-registered retained-set gate misses on sector; static method not shift-robust).**
The coupled conditional threshold does the thing the P2.1 union could not: it is **calibrated
two-sided** (not conservatively over-covering) **and the tightest method on the board** — it
recovers the ~32% width the union spent on over-coverage. On the **full** base distribution it
holds two-sided ±τ on **all three axes**. But the **pre-registered gate measures the *selective
retained* subset**, and there sector still over-covers (a selective×conditional interaction, not a
miscalibration) → by the pre-committed rule this is **QUALIFIED, not SHIP**. And the *static*
conditional method is **not shift-robust** (no online adaptation); a single global ACI offset
helps the margin but cannot fix group-specific shift.

## Layer 1a — coverage + width (mean ± sd over seeds; target 90%)
| method | base | shift | worst-group \| shift | mean width |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ACI single-axis (frozen) | 0.904 ± 0.001 | 0.867 ± 0.015 | 0.815 ± 0.029 | 8.09 |
| ACI multi-axis union (P2.1) | 0.934 ± 0.001 | 0.915 ± 0.010 | 0.881 ± 0.021 | 9.08 |
| **cqr_conditional (P2.2)** | **0.898 ± 0.015** | 0.564 ± 0.073 | 0.433 ± 0.070 | **6.18** |
| cqr_conditional+ACI (report) | 0.965 ± 0.008 | 0.702 ± 0.057 | 0.599 ± 0.071 | 8.38 |

- **Marginal base 0.898** — calibrated, *not* over-covering (the union sat at 0.934). Seed-0
  clustered band on conditional base coverage **0.881 [0.874, 0.888]**.

## G-EFFICIENCY — **PASS (clean).**
`cqr_conditional` width **6.18 < union 9.08** (−32%) and < single-axis 8.09. The union's extra
width was pure over-coverage; the coupled additive threshold (sector + cap + momentum effects, one
pinball-regression fit) prices each group without stacking three one-sided guarantees. This is the
core contribution: **calibrated multi-group coverage need not be conservative.**

## G-CALIB-MULTI — **MISS on sector (retained-set gate, as pre-registered); method-calibration CLEAN on full base.**
Two ways of measuring per-axis conditional coverage tell different stories — both reported:

**(a) Pre-registered gate — retained-70% (low-u) base subset, signed worst gap (mean over seeds):**
| axis | union (P2.1) | **conditional** | vs ±τ=5pp |
|---|---|---|---|
| sector | +0.083 | **+0.078** | ✗ (over) |
| cap_tier | +0.063 | **+0.030** | ✓ |
| mom_decile | +0.067 | **−0.036** | ✓ |

**(b) Diagnostic — FULL base set (the distribution the method actually calibrates), signed worst gap:**
| axis | union (P2.1) | **conditional** | single-axis | vs ±τ=5pp |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| sector | +0.060 | **−0.025** | +0.028 | ✓ |
| cap_tier | +0.042 | **−0.008** | +0.007 | ✓ |
| mom_decile | +0.047 | **−0.048** | +0.007 | ✓ |

**Reading.** On the **full** base distribution the conditional method holds **two-sided ±τ on all
three axes** (worst |gap| 0.048), while the union over-covers all three — exactly the calibrated
multi-group property P2.2 targeted. The **retained-set** gate still flags sector because the
**downstream selective abstention** (lowest-u 70%) removes high-u names, and within sector the
retained names are systematically easier → retained coverage drifts ~8pp above nominal. The
conditional conformal layer cannot see this: abstention is independent of, and downstream of, the
interval. So the gate-as-written **MISSES on sector**, but the miss is a **selective×conditional
interaction**, not the conditional layer miscalibrating. Per the pre-committed rule we do **not**
move the goalpost: verdict **QUALIFIED**.

## G-SHIFT — **static conditional is NOT shift-robust (documented limitation).**
| method | worst-group \| shift | shift cov | note |
|---|---|---|---|
| ACI single-axis | 0.815 | 0.867 | online, conditioned axis only |
| ACI multi-axis union | 0.881 | 0.915 | online, all axes (over-covers) |
| **cqr_conditional** | **0.433** | 0.564 | **static — collapses under the drawdown** |
| cqr_conditional+ACI | 0.599 | 0.702 | global offset helps margin, not worst-group |

The static conditional method is calibrated *in-distribution* by design and therefore **under-covers
under the shift** — precisely the failure ACI exists to fix. The report-only `cqr_conditional_aci`
hybrid (a single **global** online offset on the conditional shape; under-coverage widens) lifts
shift coverage 0.564 → 0.702 but a *global* offset **cannot repair group-specific shift**, so
worst-group stays under the 0.704 floor (0.599). The true endpoint is a **per-group adaptive**
conditional method (the conditional shape with a *group-conditional* ACI level) — logged below.

## Layer 1b (real 21d fwd return) — conditional is competitive and tighter
| method | base | shift | worst-group \| shift | width |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ACI single-axis | 0.898 | 0.898 | 0.858 | 0.275 |
| ACI multi-axis union | 0.933 | 0.934 | 0.896 | 0.306 |
| **cqr_conditional** | 0.870 | 0.799 | **0.706** (clears 0.704 floor) | **0.247** |
| cqr_conditional+ACI | 0.906 | 0.829 | 0.740 | 0.269 |

On real returns the gap narrows: `cqr_conditional` **clears the worst-group floor (0.706) at the
lowest width (0.247)**, and the hybrid reaches 0.740 — i.e. on a less-adversarial substrate the
conditional method is both calibrated and competitive on worst-group, not just efficient.

## G-PRIMARY (i) / G-NULL — unchanged
The selective score `u_i` (per-name calibration-residual scale) is independent of the conformal
interval, so abstention results are identical to P2/P2.1 (G-PRIMARY i PASS, G-NULL clean).

## Verdict (1a/1b) — QUALIFIED; Layer-2 port stays GATED OFF
**Per the pre-committed rule (ship iff retained-set G-CALIB-MULTI passes all axes two-sided AND
G-EFFICIENCY), P2.2 is QUALIFIED, not SHIP** — sector misses on the retained-set gate. Therefore
the **Layer-2 private re-test does NOT run** (the discipline: Layer-2 runs only if 1a ships, as
P2→P3 / P2.1→Layer-2). What P2.2 *does* establish, cleanly and honestly:
1. **Calibrated multi-group coverage need not be conservative** — the coupled additive threshold
   holds two-sided ±τ on all axes (full base) at **−32% width vs the union**. The union's
   over-coverage was an artifact of stacking one-sided guarantees, now removed.
2. **Two residual gaps, both diagnosed:** (a) the **selective×conditional** sector interaction —
   the abstention layer biases the retained subsample, so retained-set conditional coverage is a
   different (harder, mismatched) target than the calibration the method guarantees; (b) **shift
   robustness** — the static method needs online adaptation, and that adaptation must be
   *group-conditional*, not global.

## Next (logged, not run) — P2.3: per-group adaptive conditional conformal
The endpoint that would clear 1a cleanly: the conditional **shape** (coupled additive threshold,
the P2.2 width win) carried online with a **group-conditional** ACI level (the P2.1/aci_cqr
shift fix), instead of a single global offset. That unifies the three variants — single-axis
(shift-robust, one axis) + union (all axes, over-covers) + conditional (all axes, calibrated,
shift-fragile) — into one method that is calibrated, multi-group, *and* shift-robust. New
pre-registered experiment; **not** a retune of any frozen knob.
