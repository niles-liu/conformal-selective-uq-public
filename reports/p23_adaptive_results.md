# Results — P2.3 *per-group adaptive* conditional conformal (2026-06-30)

> Paired with `p23_adaptive_preregistration.md` (frozen first). All numbers from
> `python src/run_p23.py`, seeds {0,1,2}, target 90%. The frozen `aci_cqr`, `aci_cqr_multi`
> (P2.1), `cqr_conditional` and `cqr_conditional_aci` (P2.2) are untouched; `cqr_conditional_gaci`
> is the additive P2.3 variant. Reproduces bit-for-bit.

## Headline — **QUALIFIED (the bet is directionally confirmed; the 1a gates miss).**
Group-conditional online correction does what the pre-registration bet on: it beats the global
offset on worst-group shift coverage, **monotonically, on both layers**, while staying tighter than
the union. But on the **adversarial known-floor synthetic (1a)** it does **not** clear the 0.704
worst-group floor (0.651) **and** it over-covers the base (0.966) — the latter inherited from the
P2.2 *global* hybrid (0.965), a width-space-ACI artifact under interleaved base/shift sessions, not
something group-conditionality introduced. On the **real substrate (1b)** the same method is the
best conditional method on worst-group (0.766), keeps base near-nominal (0.910), and stays tighter
than the union (0.268 vs 0.306). Per the pre-committed rule (ship iff G-SHIFT-COND **and**
G-EFFICIENCY **and** G-BASE-CALIB all pass on 1a) this is **QUALIFIED, not SHIP**.

## Layer 1a — coverage + width (mean ± sd over seeds; target 90%) — the full lineage
| method | base | shift | worst-group \| shift | mean width |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ACI single-axis (frozen) | 0.904 ± 0.001 | 0.867 ± 0.015 | 0.815 ± 0.029 | 8.09 |
| ACI multi-axis union (P2.1) | 0.934 ± 0.001 | 0.915 ± 0.010 | 0.881 ± 0.021 | 9.08 |
| cqr_conditional (P2.2 static) | 0.898 ± 0.015 | 0.564 ± 0.073 | 0.433 ± 0.070 | 6.18 |
| cqr_conditional+ACI (P2.2 global) | 0.965 ± 0.008 | 0.702 ± 0.057 | 0.599 ± 0.071 | 8.38 |
| **cqr_conditional+gACI (P2.3)** | 0.966 ± 0.009 | 0.704 ± 0.057 | **0.651 ± 0.071** | **8.35** |

**The monotone signal (the contribution).** Worst-group|shift climbs **static 0.433 → global
0.599 → group-adaptive 0.651** — each step adds exactly the structure the pre-reg argued for
(static→online, then global→group-conditional). The group-conditional `d[k,ℓ]` term lifts
worst-group **+0.052 over the global offset** at essentially equal width (8.35 vs 8.38). So *per-group*
adaptation is strictly the better online correction — the directional claim is confirmed.

## G-SHIFT-COND — **MISS (worst-group floor), shift-marginal OK.**
`cqr_conditional_gaci` worst-group|shift **0.651 < floor 0.704**. Shift-marginal 0.704 is within
±τ_shift of 90% (OK). The group correction closes 36% of the static→union worst-group gap
(0.433→0.881) that the global offset alone closed only 23% of — real, but short of the floor on the
most adversarial groups. **Why it can't catch up on 1a:** the method *starts* from the calibrated
(narrow) conditional shape and widens **online**, so within the finite test horizon the slow
(γ=0.05) per-group correction can't fully reach the floor for the worst sector under the severe
synthetic drawdown — where even the always-over-covering union reaches only 0.881 and single-axis
ACI only 0.815.

## G-BASE-CALIB — **MISS (base over-covers, 0.966), and the diagnosis is the key result.**
Base coverage **0.966** (seed-0 clustered band **0.968 [0.965, 0.971]**) — 6.6pp over nominal,
outside ±τ. **This is not a group-conditionality effect:** the P2.2 *global* hybrid already sits at
0.965; gACI adds only +0.001. It is a **width-space online-ACI × interleaved-regime** artifact: in
1a the test stream interleaves base and shift sessions; under the severe shift sessions the
width-space offset `c` inflates, and because it relaxes only at rate γ·scale per session it does
**not** settle back before the (more numerous) base sessions, which therefore inherit the inflated
width. The frozen **alpha-space** `aci_cqr` does **not** show this (base 0.904) — its per-group
α-level update with empirical quantiles is self-correcting in a way the width-space additive offset
on a single fitted shape is not. **This is a genuine design tension, not a tunable miss:** the
conditional *shape* is one pinball regression, so there is no per-group empirical-quantile object to
run an alpha-space ACI against without re-introducing the Mondrian sparsity P2.2 was built to avoid.

## G-EFFICIENCY — **PASS.**
`cqr_conditional_gaci` width **8.35 < union 9.08** (−8%). The width win over the union survives
adding the online correction (the static conditional was 6.18; online adaptation spends ~2.2 of
width to chase shift coverage, still landing under the union).

## G-CALIB-MULTI (report) — per-axis SIGNED worst gap (mean over seeds; ±τ=0.05)
| axis | FULL base | retained-70% |
|---|---|---|
| sector | +0.079 (over) | +0.095 (over) |
| cap_tier | +0.069 (over) | +0.080 (over) |
| mom_decile | +0.074 (over) | +0.085 (over) |

All axes now **over**-cover on both the full base and the retained set — a direct consequence of the
global base over-coverage above (G-BASE-CALIB), which lifts every group uniformly. (Contrast P2.2's
static `cqr_conditional`, which held two-sided ±τ on all three axes on the full base.) The
retained-set sector residual that flagged in P2.2 is therefore *subsumed* by the larger base
over-coverage here and is not separately diagnostic — as pre-committed, it was never a P2.3
ship-blocker.

## Layer 1b (real 21d fwd return) — gACI is the best conditional method
| method | base | shift | worst-group \| shift | width |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ACI single-axis | 0.898 | 0.898 | 0.858 | 0.275 |
| ACI multi-axis union | 0.933 | 0.934 | 0.896 | 0.306 |
| cqr_conditional (static) | 0.870 | 0.799 | 0.706 | 0.247 |
| cqr_conditional+ACI (global) | 0.906 | 0.829 | 0.740 | 0.269 |
| **cqr_conditional+gACI (P2.3)** | **0.910** | 0.832 | **0.766** | **0.268** |

On the real substrate the method largely delivers the unification: **base near-nominal (0.910, within
±τ)**, **worst-group 0.766** (best of every conditional method, clears the 0.704 floor and beats the
global hybrid's 0.740), at **width 0.268 < union 0.306**. The contrast with 1a is itself the lesson:
the base over-coverage and floor-miss are products of the **known-floor synthetic's deliberately
severe shift** (1a static-conditional shift 0.564 vs 1b 0.799) pumping the width-space offset — on a
realistically-mild shift the offset never over-inflates and the method behaves as designed.

## G-PRIMARY (i) / G-NULL — unchanged
The selective score `u_i` is independent of the conformal interval, so abstention results are
identical to P2/P2.1/P2.2 (G-PRIMARY i PASS, G-NULL clean).

## Verdict (1a/1b) — QUALIFIED; Layer-2 port stays GATED OFF
**Per the pre-committed rule, P2.3 is QUALIFIED, not SHIP** — G-EFFICIENCY passes but G-SHIFT-COND
(worst-group floor) and G-BASE-CALIB (base over-cover) miss on 1a. Therefore the **Layer-2 private
re-test does NOT run** (the discipline: Layer-2 runs only if 1a ships). What P2.3 establishes,
honestly:
1. **Per-group online correction strictly dominates a global offset on worst-group shift coverage**
   — monotone on both layers (1a 0.599→0.651; 1b 0.740→0.766) at equal width, under the union.
   The directional hypothesis is confirmed.
2. **The remaining gap is a single, well-identified design tension**, not a tuning failure: a
   *width-space* online offset on a *single fitted* conditional shape over-covers the base when
   severe shift and base sessions interleave (the offset relaxes too slowly), whereas the frozen
   *alpha-space* per-group ACI does not. Reconciling alpha-space per-group adaptation with the
   single-regression conditional shape — without re-introducing Mondrian per-group sparsity — is the
   open methods question. On a realistically-mild real shift (1b) the tension does not bite and the
   method is the best conditional variant on the board.

## Next (logged, not run)
The method ladder has reached a clean diagnostic endpoint: the four conditional variants now map the
full tradeoff surface (calibrated-static, global-online, union, group-online), and the residual is a
named design tension rather than a knob. The recommended path is **not** a P2.4 retune but **P5 —
write up the lineage** (the progression and its diagnosed limits is the scientific contribution; a
forced SHIP would not be). If a future pass does revisit the method, the one principled move is
alpha-space group-conditional adaptation on the conditional shape (above) — a new pre-registered
experiment, not a retune of any frozen knob.
