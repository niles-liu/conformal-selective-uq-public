# Results — P2 method (2026-06-30)

> Paired with `p2_method_preregistration.md` (frozen first). All numbers from
> `python src/run_p2.py`, multi-seed {0,1,2}, target 90%. Splits: train rd<20210101 ·
> calibrate 2021 (calm) · test rd≥20220101 (2022 = shift). Bands = sector×month
> clustered bootstrap. Knobs (γ=0.05, K=20, MIN_N=50, Mondrian/ACI dim = `mom_decile`)
> frozen in the pre-reg. Reproduces bit-for-bit from the seeded run.

## Headline
**Group-conditional ACI closes the shift gap that static conformal cannot, and the
per-name selective score abstains in the mechanistically-right place.** Three of four
gates pass decisively (G-SHIFT, G-MECHANISM, G-NULL, and G-PRIMARY i); G-PRIMARY (ii)
holds on the conditioned axes and **grazes ~1pp over τ on the un-conditioned sector
axis** — an honest, pre-registered limitation, not retro-fit away.

## Layer 1a — coverage (mean ± sd over seeds; target 90%)
| method | base | shift | worst-group \| shift |
|---|---|---|---|
| naive split | 0.902 ± 0.010 | 0.580 ± 0.060 | 0.507 ± 0.058 (sector=utilities) |
| CQR (uncond.) | 0.901 ± 0.015 | 0.573 ± 0.071 | 0.474 ± 0.078 (mom_decile 0) |
| Mondrian-CQR | 0.900 ± 0.016 | 0.572 ± 0.072 | 0.462 ± 0.113 (mom_decile 0) |
| **ACI (group-cond.)** | **0.904 ± 0.001** | **0.867 ± 0.015** | **0.815 ± 0.029** (sector=utilities) |
| weighted-CQR (ablation) | 1.000 | 0.967 | 0.937 |

- **ACI is the fix.** Worst-group under shift **0.507 → 0.815**; shift coverage
  **0.580 → 0.867** (gap to nominal 3.3pp, inside τ_shift=7pp). Seed-0 clustered band
  on ACI shift coverage: **0.856 [0.842, 0.868]** — the lift is far outside sampling noise.
- **Mondrian alone does not help G-SHIFT** (worst-group 0.462 ≈ baseline): the shift is
  *temporal*, not static-group, so static per-group recalibration on the calm 2021 fold
  can't track it. This is exactly why the online (ACI) layer is the one that works — a
  clean, interpretable ablation contrast.
- **Weighted-CQR over-covers and is uninformative** (coverage→1.0, ~3× width on 1b): the
  covariate-shift reweighting over-corrects because the regime shift lives largely in a
  *latent* (the injected overlay), not in the observed covariate density. Reinforces that
  adapting to *realized miscoverage* (ACI), not to covariate density, is the right tool here.

## G-PRIMARY (i) — useful abstention (retained MAE @ 70%, mean over seeds)
| | full | random | **method (u_i)** | oracle (σ_irr) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| retained MAE @70% | 2.030 | 2.029 | **1.852** | 1.791 |

- Reduction vs random = **0.1775 ≥ Δ = 0.119** → **PASS**. Per-seed reductions
  [0.197, 0.174, 0.162], min 0.162 — the multi-seed band excludes Δ, let alone 0.
- The per-name calibration-residual score **nearly matches the oracle** across the whole
  risk–coverage curve (e.g. @50%: method 1.686 vs oracle 1.636; @30%: 1.534 vs 1.490) —
  it captures ~75% of the oracle's headroom that naive interval width (P1) captured *none* of.

## G-PRIMARY (ii) — conditional coverage on the retained 70% (per seed, max |gap| vs 90%)
| dimension | seed 0 | seed 1 | seed 2 | mean |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| cap_tier | 0.038 | 0.026 | 0.037 | **0.034** ✓ |
| mom_decile | 0.037 | 0.030 | 0.029 | **0.032** ✓ |
| sector | 0.050 | 0.065 | 0.065 | **0.060** ✗ (τ=5pp) |

**Qualified.** Coverage on the retained set holds within ±5pp on the two axes the method
conditions on (cap_tier, mom_decile) but drifts ~1pp over on **sector** — the dimension
the pre-registered conditioning knob (`mom_decile`) does **not** control. This is a fair,
un-optimized test and a real, documented limitation. *Not* fixed post-hoc by re-tuning the
frozen knob; the principled extension (sector-inclusive / multi-dimensional Mondrian
conditioning) is logged as P2.1, deferred for explicit go-ahead.

## G-SHIFT — **PASS**
ACI worst-group \| shift = **0.815 ± 0.029 ≥ 0.704**; shift coverage 0.867 within ±7pp of
0.90. The gap naive split-conformal demonstrably fails (0.507) is closed.

## G-MECHANISM (1a) — **PASS**
| statistic | value | threshold |
|---|---|---|
| AUC(−u_i → recoverable_mask) | **0.813 ± 0.034** | θ = 0.70 ✓ |
| Spearman(u_i, irreducible_σ_i) | **0.856 ± 0.044** | θ′ = 0.40 ✓ |
| **Spearman(u_i, σ_irr \| vol_63)** (confound guard) | **0.862 ± 0.041** | survives ✓ |

The selective score abstains in the *right* place: low-uncertainty names are the
recoverable ones (AUC 0.81), and per-name uncertainty tracks the injected irreducible
noise (ρ 0.86) — and the association **survives partialling out per-name vol_63**
(partial ρ 0.86, essentially unchanged), so it is not a volatility confound. This is the
checkable-mechanism claim the known-floor task was built to support.

## G-NULL — **PASS**
Shuffle y within date → the selective advantage @70% collapses to **0.0018 ± 0.0026**
(vs the real 0.1775). No leakage: the abstention signal is genuinely in the name↔noise link.

## Layer 1b — real public task (21d fwd return), external validity
| method | base | shift | worst-group \| shift | width |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| naive split | 0.902 | 0.850 | 0.734 (mom_decile 0) | 0.281 |
| CQR | 0.884 | 0.814 | 0.775 (industrials) | 0.248 |
| Mondrian-CQR | 0.883 | 0.813 | 0.773 (industrials) | 0.248 |
| **ACI** | **0.898** | **0.898** | **0.858** (materials) | 0.275 |
| weighted (ablation) | 1.000 | 0.998 | 0.989 | 0.849 |

- ACI lifts worst-group **0.734 → 0.858** and holds shift coverage at nominal (0.898) on
  *real* forward returns — the G-SHIFT story is not a synthetic artifact.
- Selective (i): retained MAE @70% random 0.0712 → method 0.0636 (**reduction 0.0076 > 0**,
  null advantage 0.0004 ≈ 0). The per-name persistence signal is real but **much weaker** on
  forward returns (closer to a martingale) than on the 1a allocator — the honest external read.
  (No frozen Δ on 1b; the 1a Δ=0.119 is in 1a target units.)

## 4-lens adversarial check
- **Reproduce** ✓ — single seeded driver; γ/K/MIN_N/dim as frozen; bit-for-bit per seed.
- **Leakage** ✓ — ACI emits session t's interval from α carried out of the *past*, revealing
  y_t only to update α_{t+1} (PIT-valid). u_i from the disjoint 2021 calib fold only.
  G-NULL collapses (0.0018), confirming no train/calib→test label leak.
- **Statistics** ✓ — sector×month clustered bands (not row); worst-group n≥50; multi-seed sd.
- **Mechanism** ✓ — the recoverability association **survives the vol_63 control** (the
  pre-registered confound guard); ACI vs Mondrian ablation isolates *temporal* adaptation
  as the active ingredient, not generic recalibration.

## Verdict
**Method validated.** G-SHIFT, G-MECHANISM, G-NULL, G-PRIMARY(i): clean multi-seed passes
on the controlled 1a task, with G-SHIFT replicating on the real 1b task. The single
qualified item — G-PRIMARY(ii) sector coverage ~1pp over τ on the un-conditioned axis — is
documented honestly and its principled fix deferred (P2.1) rather than retro-fit. The
contribution claim (pre-registered, mechanism-validated, shift-robust selective conformal
regression) stands. Next: the private real-data confirm (held separately) → P4 writeup.
