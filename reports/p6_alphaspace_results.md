# Results — P6 *alpha-space* group-conditional adaptation on the single-regression shape (2026-06-30)

> Paired with `p6_alphaspace_preregistration.md` (frozen first). All numbers from
> `python src/run_p6.py`, seeds {0,1,2}, target 90%. The frozen lineage (`aci_cqr`, `aci_cqr_multi`,
> `cqr_conditional`, `cqr_conditional_aci`, `cqr_conditional_gaci`) is **untouched** and reproduces the
> P2.3 table bit-for-bit; `cqr_conditional_qaci` (global, alpha-space) and `cqr_conditional_gqaci`
> (group, alpha-space, **headline**) are the new additive variants.

## Headline — **QUALIFIED, and the P5-named design tension is RESOLVED.**
The open methods question that closed the P5 ladder — *can the alpha-space (quantile-level) update be run
against the single-regression conditional shape, fixing the width-space base over-coverage without
re-introducing Mondrian per-group sparsity?* — is answered **yes** on the two gates it targeted, and the
mechanism diagnosis (`p5_archival_note.md` §5.3) is **confirmed exactly**:

- **G-BASE-CALIB PASS** — alpha-space `cond+gqACI` holds base at **0.900** (dead nominal), where the
  width-space `cond+gACI` over-covered at **0.966**. Both alpha-space variants sit at nominal (qACI
  0.904, gqACI 0.900); both width-space variants over-cover (~0.965). A clean 2×2 confirmation that the
  base over-coverage was a **width-space artifact**, not a property of group-conditionality or of the
  coupled shape.
- **G-EFFICIENCY PASS, and decisively** — `cond+gqACI` width **6.715**, the **tightest online method on
  the board**: −26% vs the union (9.076), −20% vs the width-space `cond+gACI` (8.348), and below every
  other online variant. Alpha-space spends far less width because it shifts the *quantile level* rather
  than inflating raw width to chase coverage.
- **G-SHIFT-COND MISS** on the deliberately-severe synthetic — `cond+gqACI` worst-group|shift **0.655 <
  0.704 floor**, and shift-marginal **0.679** falls below the ±0.07 band. Per the pre-committed rule
  (ship iff all three of G-BASE-CALIB, G-SHIFT-COND, G-EFFICIENCY pass on 1a) → **QUALIFIED, not SHIP.**

The honest framing: **P6 resolves the design tension P5 named (alpha-space removes the base
over-coverage at materially lower width — the reconciliation works), but the adversarial-1a worst-group
floor remains the same horizon-bounded wall the whole family hits** (even the always-over-covering union
reaches only 0.881; single-axis ACI 0.815). The coupled-shape family now attains its **best-ever
worst-group at its lowest-ever width**, calibrated at nominal — it simply does not clear 0.704 on the
worst sector under the synthetic's severe interleaved drawdown within the finite test horizon.

## Layer 1a — the full 2×2 (width-space vs alpha-space) × (global vs group); seeds {0,1,2}, target 90%
| variant | space | scope | base | shift | **worst-group \| shift** | mean width |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ACI single-axis (frozen) | — | 1 axis | 0.904 | 0.867 | 0.815 | 8.093 |
| ACI multi-axis union (P2.1) | — | union | 0.934 | 0.915 | **0.881** | 9.076 |
| cqr_conditional (P2.2 static) | — | shape | 0.898 | 0.564 | 0.433 | 6.178 |
| cqr_conditional+ACI (P2.2) | width | global | 0.965 | 0.702 | 0.599 | 8.376 |
| cqr_conditional+gACI (P2.3) | width | group | 0.966 | 0.704 | 0.651 | 8.348 |
| **cqr_conditional+qACI (P6)** | **alpha** | global | **0.904** | **0.797** | **0.683** | **7.605** |
| **cqr_conditional+gqACI (P6, headline)** | **alpha** | group | **0.900** | 0.679 | 0.655 | **6.715** |

Four readings, each a finding:

1. **The base fix (the contribution).** The alpha-space row is calibrated at nominal (0.904 / 0.900); the
   width-space row over-covers (0.965 / 0.966). Moving the *quantile level* on the fitted family — bounded
   by the calibration conformity-score distribution — cannot inflate the way an unbounded additive width
   offset does. **The §5.3 tension is resolved.** (G-ALPHA-FIX: |base−nominal| alpha 0.000 vs width 0.066.)
2. **The width win, amplified.** Every alpha-space variant is **tighter than its width-space twin** (qACI
   7.605 < cond+ACI 8.376; gqACI 6.715 < gACI 8.348) and the headline is tightest of all online methods,
   −26% under the union. The P2.2 width win not only survives going online — it **widens**.
3. **The sweet spot is the GLOBAL alpha variant on 1a.** `cond+qACI` is the strongest coupled-shape
   method here: nominal base (0.904), the **highest worst-group of the entire coupled-shape family**
   (0.683 > gACI 0.651 > cond+ACI 0.599), best shift-marginal of that family (0.797), at low width
   (7.605). It still misses the 0.704 floor, but by the smallest margin the family has achieved.
4. **"More structure" does NOT monotonically help in alpha-space (the honest reversal).** In width-space,
   adding the per-group term lifted worst-group (0.599 → 0.651). In **alpha-space it does not**: the group
   term slightly *lowers* worst-group (qACI 0.683 → gqACI 0.655) and shift-marginal (0.797 → 0.679),
   buying tighter width (7.605 → 6.715) instead. Under the severe interleaved shift, the bounded per-group
   level offsets tighten the easier groups faster than they widen the worst sector. This is reported, not
   hidden — it is the new, smaller open question P6 leaves (see §Next).

## G-BASE-CALIB — **PASS (the point of P6).**
`cond+gqACI` base **0.900 ± 0.003** (seed-0 clustered band **0.896 [0.891, 0.900]**), inside ±τ=0.05.
The width-space `cond+gACI` 0.966 (band [0.965,0.971]) is decisively outside. Alpha-space adaptation
keeps the in-distribution calibration the static shape has, which width-space online adaptation broke.

## G-SHIFT-COND — **MISS (worst-group floor + shift-marginal), same horizon wall as the family.**
`cond+gqACI` worst-group|shift **0.655 < 0.704** and shift-marginal **0.679** (below 0.90−0.07). The
global `cond+qACI` is closer (0.683 worst-group, 0.797 shift) but also short. The wall is the documented
one: under the severe synthetic drawdown the finite test horizon and the γ=0.05 rate cannot lift the
worst sector to the floor — even the union (always-over-covering, +0.36 wider) reaches only 0.881.

## G-EFFICIENCY — **PASS (decisive).**
`cond+gqACI` width **6.715 < union 9.076** (−26%) and below every online variant. The alpha-space family
is the efficiency frontier of the lineage.

## G-ALPHA-FIX (report — mechanism) — **CONFIRMED.**
|base − nominal|: alpha-space `cond+gqACI` **0.000** vs width-space `cond+gACI` **0.066**; global pair
identical story (qACI 0.904 vs cond+ACI 0.965). The §5.3 diagnosis — that the base over-coverage is a
*width-space-ACI × interleaved-regime* artifact, absent in alpha-space — is directly confirmed by
swapping only the correction space on the same fitted shape.

**α_eff interiority probe (4-lens mechanism, seed 0, scratchpad).** Realised per-point α_eff: median
**0.089** (≈ nominal α=0.10), interior to the [0.01,0.50] clamp for **85.4%** of test points; upper clamp
(narrowest) **never** hit; lower clamp (widest = the 0.99 family node) binds for **14.6%** — the
severe-shift worst groups, exactly where max width is wanted. The global offset `a` rides its lower
anti-windup bound (−0.09) in 41% of sessions during shift but is bounded, so it relaxes immediately when
shift passes (no windup — the mechanism the width-space `c` lacked). **The width is set by the
adaptation, not by the grid clamp.**

## G-CALIB-MULTI (report) — per-axis SIGNED worst gap (mean over seeds; ±τ=0.05)
| axis | FULL base (gqACI) | retained-70% (gqACI) |
|---|---|---|
| sector | +0.003 OK | +0.063 over |
| cap_tier | +0.000 OK | +0.034 OK |
| mom_decile | +0.000 OK | +0.033 OK |

On the **full base** all three axes are dead-on (≤+0.003) — the uniform over-coverage that gACI showed
on every axis (+0.079/+0.069/+0.074) is **gone**, a direct consequence of the base fix. The retained-70%
**sector** residual (+0.063) is the **known P2.2/P2.3 selective×conditional interaction** (the selective
layer is unmodified) — pre-committed as reported, **not a P6 ship-blocker**.

## Layer 1b (real 21d fwd return) — alpha-space is the best conditional family on worst-group
| variant | space/scope | base | shift | worst-group \| shift | width |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ACI single-axis | — | 0.898 | 0.898 | 0.858 | 0.275 |
| ACI multi-axis union | — | 0.933 | 0.934 | 0.896 | 0.306 |
| cqr_conditional (static) | — | 0.870 | 0.799 | 0.706 | 0.247 |
| cqr_conditional+ACI | width/global | 0.906 | 0.829 | 0.740 | 0.269 |
| cqr_conditional+gACI (P2.3) | width/group | 0.910 | 0.832 | 0.766 | 0.268 |
| **cqr_conditional+qACI (P6)** | alpha/global | 0.898 | **0.888** | **0.819** | 0.283 |
| **cqr_conditional+gqACI (P6)** | alpha/group | 0.860 | 0.850 | **0.823** | **0.249** |

On the realistically-mild real shift the alpha-space variants are the **best coupled-shape methods on
worst-group**: `cond+qACI` 0.819 and `cond+gqACI` 0.823 both clear the 0.704 floor, beat the width-space
gACI (0.766), and approach the union's 0.896 at **far lower width** (0.283 / 0.249 vs 0.306).
`cond+qACI` very nearly ships outright on 1b: base near-nominal (0.898), **shift-marginal within ±τ
(0.888)**, worst-group 0.819, width 0.283 < union. `cond+gqACI` runs slightly under on base (0.860, just
inside |·−0.90|<0.05) for the tightest interval on the board (0.249). The 1a/1b contrast is again the
lesson: the 1a worst-group miss is a product of the synthetic's deliberately-severe shift, not the method.

## Verdict (1a/1b) — QUALIFIED; Layer-2 port stays GATED OFF
Per the pre-committed rule, P6 is **QUALIFIED, not SHIP** — **G-BASE-CALIB and G-EFFICIENCY pass**, but
**G-SHIFT-COND misses** the worst-group floor on the adversarial 1a. Therefore the **Layer-2 private
re-test does NOT run** (Layer-2 runs only if 1a ships). What P6 establishes, honestly:

1. **The P5-named design tension is resolved.** Alpha-space group-conditional adaptation can be run
   against the single coupled regression shape — adapting the quantile *level* per group, with **no
   per-group empirical quantiles and no Mondrian sparsity** — and it **removes the width-space base
   over-coverage** (0.966 → 0.900, dead nominal) **at lower width** (8.35 → 6.72, −26% vs union). This
   is the reconciliation P5 §8 logged as the open question, and it works.
2. **The adversarial-1a worst-group floor is a horizon wall, not a knob.** No coupled-shape variant in
   either correction space clears 0.704 under the severe synthetic shift; the global alpha variant comes
   closest (0.683) at the family's lowest width. On the mild real shift (1b) the alpha-space family is the
   best coupled method on worst-group (0.819/0.823, clears the floor, beats gACI's 0.766, near-union at
   far lower width), with `cond+qACI` nearly the full unification (nominal base, in-band shift,
   floor-clearing worst-group, tighter than union).
3. **A new, smaller open question (logged, not run):** in alpha-space the per-group term does **not**
   monotonically dominate the global one on the adversarial 1a (qACI 0.683 → gqACI 0.655 worst-group) —
   the bounded level offsets tighten easy groups faster than they widen the worst sector under severe
   interleaved shift. A principled follow-up would make the per-group level rate *asymmetric* (slower to
   tighten than to widen) — again a fresh pre-registration, not a retune.

No frozen knob (γ, the level grid Λ, the clamps) was tuned post-hoc to manufacture a pass.

## 4-lens adversarial check
- **Reproduce** — the frozen five reproduce the P2.3 table bit-for-bit; a second full `run_p6.py`
  reproduces the new variants' numbers bit-for-bit (deterministic: seeded data, `highs` solver, no
  randomness in the conformal layer). *(confirmed identical on re-run.)*
- **Leakage** — the level family is fit only on calibration `E` + group indicators (no test labels);
  online `a, b, α_eff` at session `s` use only sessions `<s`, and `y_s` is revealed after the interval is
  emitted (PIT). The selective layer is unchanged, so G-NULL still collapses (shared with P2/P2.1/P2.2/P2.3).
- **Statistics** — base-coverage band from the clustered (sector×month) bootstrap, not row bootstrap
  ([0.891,0.900] on the headline); worst-group read with the same `min_n=50` as every prior phase;
  multi-seed {0,1,2} mean±sd throughout.
- **Mechanism** — the α_eff probe confirms the base fix comes from genuine interior adaptation (median
  α_eff ≈ nominal, 85% interior, never pinned narrow), not the grid clamp; the anti-windup bound on `a`
  is what gives the fast relaxation the width-space `c` lacked. G-ALPHA-FIX isolates the cause by changing
  *only* the correction space on an otherwise-identical pipeline.
