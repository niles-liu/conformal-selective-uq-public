# Results — P7 *cross-axis level combination* for alpha-space group adaptation (2026-06-30)

> Paired with `p7_levelcomb_preregistration.md` (frozen first). All numbers from `python src/run_p7.py`,
> seeds {0,1,2}, target 90%. The prior lineage (union, static shape, `cond+qACI`, `cond+gqACI`)
> reproduces the P6 table bit-for-bit within this run (a regression check that P7 left it untouched);
> `cqr_conditional_gqaci_max` (headline) and `cqr_conditional_gqaci_asym` (secondary) are the new
> additive variants.

## Headline — **QUALIFIED; the cross-axis cancellation hypothesis is CONFIRMED.**
P6 left a sub-question: on the adversarial 1a the *group* alpha variant lost to the *global* one on
worst-group, and the **worst group changed axis** (global `cond+qACI` worst = sector=tech; additive
`cond+gqACI` worst = mom_decile=0.0) — the signature of **cross-axis additive cancellation** (a point
easy on two axes but hard on one has its hard-axis widening cancelled by the easy axes' tightening).
P7 tests the fix: combine the per-axis level offsets by the **most-conservative (widest) axis** (`min`)
instead of the **sum**. The diagnosis holds:

- **G-GROUP-HELPS PASS** — `cond+gqACI-max` worst-group|shift **0.687 > global 0.683 > additive 0.655**:
  removing the cancellation makes the group term add value over the global offset, **reversing the P6
  finding**. The mechanism is confirmed by the **worst group reverting to sector=tech** (the additive
  variant's spurious mom_decile=0.0 collapse is gone). **But the 1a effect is small (+0.004 over global.)**
- **G-BASE-CALIB PASS** (0.905, nominal) and **G-EFFICIENCY PASS** (7.401 < union 9.076): the max
  combination is wider than additive (6.715 → 7.401, no cancellation) but stays well under the union and
  keeps base calibrated. Per the pre-committed rule the **direction ships** (all three co-primaries pass).
- **G-SHIFT-COND MISS** — worst-group **0.687 < 0.704 floor**, shift 0.770 below the ±0.07 band → **the
  full SHIP bar (Layer-2) is not met: QUALIFIED.** The adversarial-1a worst-group floor is the same
  family-wide horizon wall every variant hits (union only 0.881).

**The real-substrate payoff (1b) is where the fix matters.** On the realistically-mild shift,
`cond+gqACI-max` is the **best coupled-shape method to date**: base 0.899 (nominal), **shift 0.896
(in-band)**, **worst-group 0.860** (vs additive 0.823, global 0.819; approaching the union's 0.896),
width 0.281 < union 0.306 — near the full unification at far lower width. The cancellation fix that was
worth only +0.004 on the synthetic is worth **+0.037 worst-group on real data**.

## Layer 1a — cross-axis combination head-to-head; seeds {0,1,2}, target 90%
| variant | combination | base | shift | **worst-group \| shift** | width | worst axis |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ACI multi-axis union (P2.1) | union of 3 intervals | 0.934 | 0.915 | **0.881** | 9.076 | sector |
| cqr_conditional (static) | — | 0.898 | 0.564 | 0.433 | 6.178 | mom_decile |
| cond+qACI (P6 global) | none (global level) | 0.904 | 0.797 | 0.683 | 7.605 | sector=tech |
| cond+gqACI (P6 additive) | **Σ** across axes | 0.900 | 0.679 | 0.655 | 6.715 | **mom_decile=0.0** |
| **cond+gqACI-max (P7, headline)** | **min** (most-conservative) | 0.905 | 0.770 | **0.687** | 7.401 | sector=tech |
| cond+gqACI-asym (P7, secondary) | Σ, slower-to-tighten | 0.911 | 0.783 | 0.695 | 7.581 | sector=tech |

Readings:
1. **Cancellation confirmed (the finding).** Switching only the *combination* (additive → max) lifts
   worst-group 0.655 → 0.687 and **relocates the worst group off the cancellation-induced mom_decile=0.0
   back to sector=tech** — the same worst axis as the global variant, i.e. the group term is no longer
   creating a spurious collapse. The additive gqACI's worst-group deficit vs global was a
   cross-axis-cancellation artifact, as hypothesised.
2. **Effect size is small on 1a (honest).** Max beats global by only **+0.004** worst-group (per-seed
   [0.000, 0.006, 0.006]). The group term *helps* once cancellation is removed, but modestly — on the
   severe synthetic the level family's conditional shape already carries most of the group structure, so
   the online per-group term has little left to add. The secondary **asym** arm is comparable (0.695,
   +0.012 over global), slightly higher worst-group but looser (7.581) and higher base (0.911).
3. **Still short of the floor.** Neither combination clears 0.704 on 1a — the horizon wall (finite test
   stream × γ=0.05 × the deliberately-severe drawdown) that bounds the *entire* family, coupled or union.

## G-GROUP-HELPS — **PASS** (max > both global and additive, per-seed paired).
Mean worst-group|shift: max 0.687 > global (qACI) 0.683 and > additive (gqACI) 0.655. Per-seed
max−global = [0.000, 0.006, 0.006] (never negative) — the improvement is directionally consistent across
seeds though small. The pre-registered strict-inequality gate passes.

## G-BASE-CALIB — **PASS.** base 0.905 ± 0.001 (seed-0 clustered band **0.905 [0.899,0.909]**), within ±τ.
The max combination does not reintroduce the width-space over-coverage; it stays as calibrated as P6's
additive gqACI (0.900).

## G-EFFICIENCY — **PASS.** width 7.401 < union 9.076 (−18%).
Max is wider than additive gqACI (6.715, no cross-axis cancellation to narrow it) but comfortably under
the union, and tighter than the global qACI (7.605) — the conditioning still buys efficiency.

## G-SHIFT-COND (report) — **MISS.** worst-group 0.687 < 0.704; shift 0.770 < 0.90−0.07.
The family horizon wall on the adversarial synthetic, unchanged by the combination fix.

## G-CALIB-MULTI (report) — per-axis SIGNED worst gap (mean over seeds; ±τ=0.05)
| axis | FULL base (gqACI-max) | retained-70% |
|---|---|---|
| sector | +0.029 OK | +0.072 over |
| cap_tier | +0.007 OK | +0.039 OK |
| mom_decile | +0.019 OK | +0.046 OK |

Full-base two-sided ±τ on all three axes (the conditional calibration target holds). The retained-70%
sector residual (+0.072) is the standing **selective×conditional interaction** (selective layer
unmodified) — reported, not a ship-blocker, as pre-committed.

## Layer 1b (real 21d fwd return) — the cross-axis fix delivers the best coupled method
| variant | base | shift | worst-group \| shift | width |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ACI multi-axis union | 0.933 | 0.934 | 0.896 | 0.306 |
| cqr_conditional (static) | 0.870 | 0.799 | 0.706 | 0.247 |
| cond+qACI (P6 global) | 0.898 | 0.888 | 0.819 | 0.283 |
| cond+gqACI (P6 additive) | 0.860 | 0.850 | 0.823 | 0.249 |
| **cond+gqACI-max (P7)** | **0.899** | **0.896** | **0.860** | 0.281 |
| cond+gqACI-asym (P7) | 0.902 | 0.911 | **0.869** | 0.283 |

On the real substrate the combination fix is **substantial**, not marginal: `cond+gqACI-max` reaches
worst-group **0.860** (best of every coupled variant, +0.037 over additive gqACI, approaching the union's
0.896) with **base 0.899 and shift 0.896 both near-nominal/in-band** at width **0.281 < union 0.306**.
`cond+gqACI-asym` edges it on worst-group (0.869) but runs shift a touch high (0.911). The 1a/1b contrast
is the by-now-familiar lesson: the synthetic's deliberately-severe shift compresses the online layer's
room to work; on a realistic shift the reconciled alpha-space + cross-axis-conservative family delivers
**calibrated-on-both-regimes, worst-group-robust, tighter-than-union** — the combination no single prior
variant achieved.

## Verdict (1a/1b) — QUALIFIED; Layer-2 stays GATED OFF
Per the pre-committed rule, P7's **direction ships** (G-GROUP-HELPS + G-BASE-CALIB + G-EFFICIENCY all
pass on 1a) but the **full SHIP bar misses** (G-SHIFT-COND floor) → **QUALIFIED**; the Layer-2 private
re-test does **not** run. What P7 establishes, honestly:

1. **The P6 reversal is explained and fixed:** the additive group term lost to the global one because of
   **cross-axis level cancellation**; combining axes by the most-conservative one (union-in-level-space
   on the single fitted shape, still no per-group sparsity) restores group > global and relocates the
   worst group off the spurious axis. Confirmed on both layers.
2. **On the adversarial synthetic the win is small (+0.004)** and still under the 0.704 horizon wall;
   **on real data it is material (+0.037 worst-group)**, making `cond+gqACI-max` the best coupled-shape
   method on the board — near-nominal on base *and* shift, worst-group approaching the union, tighter
   than the union.
3. **The secondary asymmetric-rate arm behaves comparably** (slightly higher worst-group, slightly looser
   / higher base) — reported, not separately gated; it is not needed given `max` is the cleaner, better-
   calibrated, tighter headline.

No frozen knob (γ, Λ, clamps, ρ, the min combination) was tuned post-hoc. **Residual open question:** the
adversarial-1a worst-group floor is bounded by the test horizon and γ, common to the whole family — not
addressable by the coupled-shape combination/rate; it would need a different lever (e.g. a faster online
rate on the worst-covered group only, or a longer calibration-into-shift horizon) — a fresh
pre-registration, not a retune.

## 4-lens adversarial check
- **Reproduce** — the prior lineage reproduces the P6 table bit-for-bit within the P7 run (union 9.076,
  static 6.178, qACI 7.605, gqACI 6.715 — identical to P6); the two new variants are deterministic by
  construction (seeded data, `highs` solver, no RNG in the conformal layer), verified array-identical on
  repeat calls. The `precomp` optimization (fit the shared CQR pieces + level family once per split
  instead of per-variant) is verified **bit-identical** to the internal path, and `run_p6.py` (which uses
  the internal path) still reproduces bit-for-bit.
- **Leakage** — level family fit only on calibration `E` + group indicators; online `a, b, α_eff` at
  session `s` use only sessions `<s`; `y_s` revealed after the interval (PIT). Selective layer unchanged
  → G-NULL still collapses.
- **Statistics** — base band from the clustered (sector×month) bootstrap ([0.899,0.909]); worst-group
  `min_n=50`; multi-seed mean±sd; G-GROUP-HELPS reported per-seed paired (same data/fold).
- **Mechanism** — the worst group reverting from mom_decile=0.0 (additive) to sector=tech (max), and the
  full-base per-axis gaps staying two-sided ±τ, confirm the gain is relocated width onto the previously-
  cancelled hard-on-one-axis points, not uniform widening (which G-EFFICIENCY / G-BASE-CALIB would have
  caught).

## Reproduce
```
python src/run_p7.py     # cross-axis max + asym vs additive/global/union/static, 1a (gated) + 1b (read)
```
Pairs with the frozen `reports/p7_levelcomb_preregistration.md`; every number reproduces bit-for-bit.
