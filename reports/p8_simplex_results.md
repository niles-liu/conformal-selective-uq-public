# Results — P8 *conformal on the simplex* (compositional target) (2026-07-01)

> Paired with `p8_simplex_preregistration.md` (frozen first, incl. the baseline read: product-region
> joint coverage 0.0000). All numbers from `python src/run_p8.py`, seeds {0,1,2}, target 90%, Layer 1a
> (the compositional substrate; 1b is forward returns — not a composition). Reproduces bit-for-bit.

## Headline — **QUALIFIED, and it lands the two substantive claims.** Joint certification on the simplex
works where independent scalars give **0%**, and the **known-floor mechanism ports to compositional
geometry**; the joint region is **not** robust to the deliberately-severe synthetic shift (documented
limitation). This is the highest-leverage extension (SPEC §11) — it makes the contribution *more honest*:
certify the allocation as **one point on the simplex**, not N unrelated scalars.

- **G-COMPO-JOINT — PASS (the core result).** The joint simplex region (Aitchison) covers the **true
  allocation vector** at **0.923** base (seed-0 month-blocked band **0.930 [0.892, 0.964]**), while the
  independent-scalar **product region covers it 0.0000** of the time — 93 marginal-90% intervals never
  all contain the truth at once. A *valid joint certification of the whole allocation exists only on the
  simplex.* The bounded-TV companion agrees (base 0.904).
- **G-COMPO-MECH — PASS, strongly (the headline novelty).** The per-name compositional difficulty
  (mean CLR deviation between the true and predicted composition) is a near-perfect index of the known
  floor: **AUC(−difficulty → recoverable_mask) = 0.861**, **Spearman(difficulty, σ_irr) = 0.967**, and
  it **survives the `vol_63` partial (0.967)** — not a volatility confound. The compositionally-hardest
  names *are* the irreducibly-bespoke ones. This is G-MECHANISM ported to the simplex — the "abstain in
  the right place" claim, now for the allocation object.
- **G-COMPO-SHIFT — MISS (the honest limitation).** Under the ×1.8-amplified 2022 shift the joint
  Aitchison region collapses to **0.000** coverage: the whole-vector shift pushes every session's
  compositional distance beyond the entire calibration score support, so even the online ACI — bounded by
  that support — cannot widen enough. The bounded-TV region degrades more gracefully (shift 0.230) but is
  still far from nominal. A joint whole-vector guarantee is intrinsically more fragile under severe shift
  than a per-coordinate one (one bad coordinate breaks the vector).

## Layer 1a — JOINT coverage: the true allocation vector ∈ region (seeds {0,1,2}, target 90%)
| region | base | shift |
|---|---|---|
| independent product (N scalars) | **0.0000 ± 0.0000** | 0.0000 ± 0.0000 |
| **simplex JOINT (Aitchison)** | **0.923 ± 0.023** | 0.000 ± 0.000 |
| simplex JOINT (TV companion) | 0.904 ± 0.008 | 0.230 ± 0.076 |
| simplex ACI (Aitchison, online) | 0.902 ± 0.002 | 0.000 ± 0.000 |

Readings:
1. **The product region cannot certify the allocation at all** (0.0000): multiplicity makes joint
   coverage of ~90 marginal intervals vanish. This is the gap P8 closes — the SPEC's "not N unrelated
   scalars" made concrete.
2. **The joint simplex region is valid and near-nominal in-regime** (Aitchison 0.923, TV 0.904, ACI
   0.902). The ACI variant pulls the base to 0.902 (tighter to nominal than the static 0.923) — online
   adaptation calibrates the base radius well.
3. **Severe compositional shift defeats the joint region** (Aitchison/ACI 0.000; TV 0.230). Honest: the
   whole 2022 allocation moves outside anything in the 2021 calibration composition-distance support, and
   a quantile-reading online rule is capped by that support.

## G-COMPO-MECH — the known-floor mechanism on the simplex (the defensible hook)
| statistic | value | threshold | pass |
|---|---|---|---|
| AUC(−compositional difficulty → recoverable_mask) | 0.861 | ≥ 0.70 | ✓ |
| Spearman(difficulty, σ_irr) | 0.967 | ≥ 0.40 | ✓ |
| partial Spearman \| vol_63 | 0.967 | ≥ 0.40 | ✓ |

The compositional difficulty tracks the injected irreducible σ almost perfectly and survives the
volatility control — the abstention/uncertainty on the simplex lands on the genuinely-bespoke names, the
same known-floor validation the scalar pipeline has (P2), now for the allocation vector. This is the part
that makes P8 publishable beyond "a valid region exists."

## Verdict (1a) — QUALIFIED; Layer-2 stays GATED OFF
Per the pre-committed rule (JOINT ∧ SHIFT ∧ MECH), P8 is **QUALIFIED**: **G-COMPO-JOINT and
G-COMPO-MECH pass** (the substantive contributions), **G-COMPO-SHIFT misses** on the deliberately-severe
synthetic. What P8 establishes, honestly:
1. **Joint conformal certification of an allocation is possible only on the simplex** — independent
   scalars give 0% joint coverage; the Aitchison/TV region gives ~90% in-regime. The first such joint
   guarantee in this repo's lineage.
2. **The known-floor mechanism ports to compositional geometry** — compositional difficulty ↔ irreducible
   σ (ρ=0.967, AUC=0.861, confound-robust). "Abstain in the right place," for the allocation vector.
3. **The joint region is not shift-robust under the severe synthetic** — a real, documented limitation
   (bounded-TV degrades more gracefully than Aitchison but neither holds); a whole-vector guarantee is
   more fragile than a per-coordinate one, and online widening is capped by the calibration support. No
   knob (`ε, γ, score, reused tolerances`) was retuned to manufacture a shift pass. Layer-2 does not run.

**A grid-refined HDR-over-simplex (arXiv 2511.18141) is infeasible at ~90 names** (exponential grid);
the scalar-score metric ball is the laptop-tractable realization and is stated as such — an honest design
choice, not a silent deviation.

## 4-lens adversarial check
- **Reproduce** — bit-for-bit from the seeded driver; base composition reconstructed exactly
  (max|w_rec − weight| = 1.4e-17); frozen learners; deterministic scores + ACI.
- **Leakage** — predicted composition uses only public features + the frozen mean model; the region uses
  only calibration scores; ACI at session `s` uses sessions `<s` (`y_s` revealed after emission → PIT).
  The mechanism uses generator ground truth (`recoverable_mask`, `σ_irr`) only for *evaluation*, never as
  a model input.
- **Statistics** — per-session coverage with a **calendar-month-blocked session bootstrap** band
  ([0.892,0.964]); multi-seed ± sd. The mechanism uses a partial-Spearman `vol_63` confound guard.
- **Mechanism** — the joint-coverage win is **not** the trivial 90% of any scalar score: the content is
  (a) it is a **joint whole-vector** statement where independent scalars give **0**, and (b) the
  compositional difficulty localizes on the known-bespoke names (ρ=0.967). The shift 0.000 is a genuine
  support-capped failure (verified: shift compositional distances exceed the max calibration score), not a
  coding artifact — the base 0.923 and ACI base 0.902 confirm the region is correct in-regime.

## Reproduce
```
python src/run_p8.py --baseline   # method-blind: product-region joint coverage 0.0000 (the failure)
python src/run_p8.py              # joint simplex region (Aitchison/TV/ACI) + G-COMPO-MECH, 1a
```
Pairs with the frozen `reports/p8_simplex_preregistration.md`; every number reproduces bit-for-bit.
