# Results — P9 *selective conformal risk control* in regression (2026-07-01)

> Paired with `p9_riskcontrol_preregistration.md` (frozen first, incl. the baseline read that set
> `α_risk=0.05, τ_risk=0.03, margin_shift=0.03, W0`). All numbers from `python src/run_p9.py`, seeds
> {0,1,2}, target coverage 90%, risk = capped miss-magnitude ∈ [0,1]. Reproduces bit-for-bit.

## Headline — **SHIP (all three co-primaries pass); the substantive result is ONLINE shift risk control.**
P9 builds the "open variant" SPEC §6 named — select-then-calibrate in **regression** (SCRC is published
for classification only). By the pre-committed rule (G-RISK-BASE ∧ G-RISK-SHIFT ∧ G-NULL) it **ships on
1a**. Read honestly, the ship rests on **one** substantive leg and two that are trivially satisfied or
null — stated plainly so the contribution is not overclaimed:

- **The win — G-RISK-SHIFT (online):** the online `scrc_aci` holds the retained-pool miss-magnitude risk
  under the severe drawdown — **0.080** vs the static `scrc`'s **0.184** (more than halved) — restoring
  retained shift coverage 0.471 → 0.738, with the risk-controlled radius **adapting** (seed-0 λ path
  0.000 → 3.516 under shift → 0.000 after). This is real online *risk* control (a proper risk, not 0/1
  coverage) under a documented shift where the static radius fails.
- **G-RISK-BASE passes trivially:** at `α_risk=0.05` the batch CRC picks radius **λ=0** — the raw CQR
  quantile intervals *already* meet the miss-magnitude target on the calm retained pool (base risk
  0.023 ≤ 0.05). The finite-sample guarantee holds, but it is not binding in-regime.
- **G-EFFICIENCY is a NULL (reported, not hidden):** because λ=0 for **both** the selected-fold and the
  full-fold CRC, there is no radius to allocate, so the "select-then-calibrate is tighter" sub-claim is
  **not demonstrated on this task** — the CQR quantiles alone suffice at this target. An honest negative.
- **G-NULL clean:** the selective risk advantage collapses under label-shuffle (0.0108 → 0.0002).

Net: **online selective conformal risk control in regression works under shift**; the batch/efficiency
story is a null at the frozen target (no post-hoc retune of `α_risk` — that is the gate-first discipline
doing its job). The selective term itself is modest (G-SELECT +0.0108); the **online risk adaptation is
the lever**, mirroring the whole project's lesson (selection helps a little, the shift-robust interval
machinery carries the result).

## Layer 1a — retained-pool risk & coverage (seeds {0,1,2}, target 90%, r=70%)
| method | risk\|base | risk\|shift | cov\|base | cov\|shift | width |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `scrc` (batch, λ_sel=0) | 0.023 ± 0.000 | 0.184 ± 0.036 | 0.846 | 0.471 | 4.675 |
| **`scrc_aci` (online)** | **0.017 ± 0.002** | **0.080 ± 0.010** | 0.882 | 0.738 | 6.520 |
| full-fold CRC (λ_full=0) | 0.023 ± 0.000 | — | — | — | 4.675 |

`Qg` (global CQR radius) 0.771; `scrc` λ_sel = full-fold λ = **0.000**. Seed-0 clustered band (sector×
month) on `scrc` base retained risk: **0.022 [0.020, 0.025]** — the base risk is tightly ≤ α_risk.

Readings:
1. **λ=0 ⇒ `scrc` intervals are the raw CQR quantiles** (no conformal margin), hence base coverage
   0.846 (< 0.90) while the *magnitude* risk is controlled (0.023 ≤ 0.05) — a clean illustration that
   **risk control ≠ coverage control**: P9 accepts a higher miss *rate* to bound the miss *magnitude*.
2. **The static radius cannot survive shift** (risk 0.184, coverage 0.471); the **online** radius does
   (0.080 / 0.738) by widening during the drawdown and relaxing after — the λ path is interior/dynamic,
   not saturated.
3. **G-RISK-SHIFT passes on both conditions:** ≤ α_risk+τ_risk = 0.08 (razor-thin: 0.080) **and**
   ≤ static − margin = 0.154 (comfortable). The absolute-band pass is marginal and reported as such; the
   beats-static margin is the robust part.

## Layer 1b (real 21d fwd return, external read)
| method | risk\|base | risk\|shift | cov\|base | cov\|shift | width |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `scrc` | 0.029 | 0.058 | 0.808 | 0.732 | 0.190 |
| `scrc_aci` | 0.029 | 0.049 | 0.810 | 0.766 | 0.196 |
| full-fold CRC | 0.029 | — | — | — | 0.190 |

On the mild real shift the static radius nearly holds (0.058) and the online variant edges it (0.049,
in-band); λ=0 again. Same **1a-severe / 1b-mild** contrast as P6/P7: the online layer's room to work
scales with shift severity.

## Per-gate
- **G-RISK-BASE — PASS.** `scrc` base retained risk 0.023 ≤ 0.05 (band [0.020,0.025]); trivially, at λ=0.
- **G-RISK-SHIFT — PASS.** `scrc_aci` shift risk 0.080 ≤ 0.08 **and** ≤ 0.154 (static 0.184 − margin).
- **G-NULL — PASS.** Real selective advantage 0.0108, shuffled 0.0002 (< ½·real = 0.0054): collapses.
- **G-EFFICIENCY — MISS (null).** λ_sel = λ_full = 0 ⇒ equal width 4.675; no radius to tighten at α_risk.
- **G-SELECT — PASS.** u-selection retained risk beats random by 0.0108 (selection is informative).

## Verdict (1a/1b) — SHIP by the pre-committed rule; scope = online shift risk control
Per the frozen rule (three co-primaries), **P9 ships on 1a**. The honest scope of what shipped: a
**pre-registered selective conformal risk-control procedure for regression whose online variant holds a
proper miss-magnitude risk under a documented severe shift** where the static radius fails, with the
leakage null clean. The batch guarantee holds but is non-binding at the frozen target, and the
select-then-calibrate efficiency sub-claim is a null on this task — **both reported, neither retuned
away.** A FULL SHIP on 1a would, per the standing discipline, license the **private real-data
confirm** (held in a separate repository); that is out of scope for this public repo.

## 4-lens adversarial check
- **Reproduce** — single seeded driver; synthetic bit-for-bit in seed; learners frozen; CRC grid + loss
  deterministic; random-selection draws seeded. Re-run gave identical numbers (verified).
- **Leakage** — the CRC radius is fit only on retained *calibration* losses; the online λ at session `s`
  uses only sessions `<s` (`y_s` revealed after the interval → PIT); selection uses covariate-side `u_i`
  only. G-NULL (label-shuffle) collapses the advantage → no leakage.
- **Statistics** — base-risk band from the sector×month clustered bootstrap (not row bootstrap);
  multi-seed mean ± sd; random-selection averaged over 20 draws.
- **Mechanism** — the shift result is genuine online adaptation, not a grid artifact: the online λ is
  **not** grid-bounded and the seed-0 path rises to 3.516 under the drawdown then relaxes to 0 — it
  tracks the shift rather than saturating. The base λ=0 (and the resulting sub-nominal base coverage) is
  the correct CRC response to a non-binding target, not a bug.

## Reproduce
```
python src/run_p9.py --baseline     # Phase A: the method-blind read that froze the gate numbers
python src/run_p9.py                 # Phase B: scrc (batch) + scrc_aci (online) + gates, 1a + 1b
```
Pairs with the frozen `reports/p9_riskcontrol_preregistration.md`; every number reproduces bit-for-bit.
